## Trading Strategies

The bot supports several trading strategies. Here are a few to consider:

### Arbitrage

Arbitrage takes advantage of price differences across exchanges. The bot will buy low on one exchange and sell high on another, securing a profit.

### Trend Following

This strategy involves following the market trend. The bot will analyze price movements and make trades based on established trends.

### Mean Reversion

Mean reversion assumes that prices will revert to their average over time. The bot will identify overbought or oversold conditions and trade accordingly.

### Scalping

Scalping is a short-term strategy that involves making small profits from numerous trades. The bot can execute trades quickly to capitalize on small price changes.
